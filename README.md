This project is a partial commitment in finalizing my Masters program in Information Technology.
This software aims to curb absentism in a work environment. 
The software usage focuses on ADMIN and STAFF only.

STAFF;
It has been developed in a way that each staff signs-up for an account with their credentials i.e name email address and password
After sign-up, each staff is assigned a unique user Id.
After this is done, each staff biometric(fingerprint) must be enrolled by the ADMIN 
A staff members' attendance is recorded with every clock-in using the fingerprint recognition scanner, and every clock-out is recorded (hence every activity is captured and recorded)
Once a staff scans his/her fingerprint, it automatically opens the particular staff members dashboard. 
On the page, a staff can REQUEST for break from ADMIN, DELETE break-request and VIEW if break-request has been approved
The dashboard also displays the total number of hours/days/months worked



ADMIN;
The ADMINS role is to enroll each and every staff members biometric 
APPROVE break-request, DENY break- request and include reason why break is denied.
